## siggy User Guide

The source for the siggy user guide. The guide is written in extended Markdown, that is supported by
[MkDocs](http://mkdocs.org).

The guide has been ported from a older implementation that was using a wiki. It is rough and out of date.
The goal is to bring it inline with the live siggy service over time.
