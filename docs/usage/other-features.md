### Exit Finder

The exit finder will locate the nearest k-space wormholes to your location. It isn't truly an "exit" finder if you have random k-space wormholes not part of your main chain mapped but it works well enough to quickly find the nearest hole you.

Simply press the button at the top (1) and then either enter a system to find a exit near (2) or click the Exits near my location button (3)
