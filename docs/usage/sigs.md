## Sigs


Signatures or sigs for short are your scanner results. Sigs are recorded in the "Scan" tab of siggy as shown in the following image:

Sigs contain entries for:
  * **Sig ID** The first three letter of the signature ID from the scan results
  * **Type** The signature type, Wormhole, Gas, Ore, Data, Relic
  * **Site** The exact site, currently all possible wormhole sites
  * **Description** A text field available to enter any desired descriptive text such as "return wh" or "site completed", etc.

## Adding Sigs
Adding signatures is simple and done above the sigs table. The only piece of information required is **sig id**, all other fields are optional. You can add as many signatures as you like, there is no limit.

## Editing Sigs

Click the pencil icon on the far left of a signature in the table to edit it. You can change all the fields of a signature just like adding it. Editing will preserve the time the signature was added to make tracking wormhole timers more convenient.
